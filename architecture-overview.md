## Data Flow

1. User initiates voice interaction via web/mobile interface
2. Voice input is captured and converted to text using Amazon Transcribe
3. Text is processed through Amazon Bedrock's Nova Sonic model
4. Relevant information is retrieved from knowledge bases
5. Response is generated and converted back to voice using Amazon Polly
6. Conversation history is stored in DynamoDB

## Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed using AWS CDK with a CI/CD pipeline implemented in GitHub. It follows a microservices architecture with containerized components managed through AWS ECS/Fargate.
